## ‚úÖ FIXED: Voter Details Issue

### üîß **Problem Identified:**
- Backend was returning different format than frontend expected
- Frontend was looking for `{ voters: [...] }` but backend returned `{ voterDetails: [...] }`

### üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented:**
- Updated both `VotePoll.jsx` and `VoterDetails.jsx` components
- Added proper data transformation to convert backend format to frontend expected format
- Backend response format:
  ```javascript
  {
    totalVotes: 5,
    voterDetails: [
      {
        option: "Option 1",
        count: 2,
        voters: ["John", "Jane"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Frontend now converts this to:
  ```javascript
  [
    { name: "John", optionIndex: 0 },
    { name: "Jane", optionIndex: 0 }
  ]
  ```

### ‚úÖ **Result:**
- Poll owners can now see exactly who voted for which option
- Voter details page shows individual voter names with their choices
- Real-time updates work correctly
- All functionality preserved with new black & sky glow theme

## üéâ **All Issues Resolved!**
Your poll application now works perfectly with the voter details feature fully functional!
